# DH150-2020W
Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities DH150: UX+UI Design, UCLA 2020 Winter

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course provides an introduction to the fields of UX research and design. It covers qualitative and quantitative user/usability research methods, including ethnographic field research, persona-scenario design, information architecture, prototyping, and usability testing. Students will learn how to design and communicate user experience design in the human-centered process.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES & LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:
- Apply a human-centered-design process 
- Evaluate a user experience design and elaborate related theory and principles in the context
- Conduct user research in qualitative methods
- Conduct usability evaluation in quantitative methods
- Develop user experience writings and visualization for interactive prototypes
- Document the design decision-making process with evidence
- Present the creative user experience design

## UX Project 
### Goal:
You will define the design problem of the current system; conduct user research to discover user's unspoken needs; and propose the creative solution by an interactive prototype for the new system. Provide the evidence how/why the solution would work with your users. 

### Delieverable:
#### One page web documentation with
* User Research
* Design process with physical artifacts
* Video of the presentation

### Process:
You will experience at least one cycle of ux process throughout the semester by 10 weekly assignments. 

### Requirements: 
- Interactive prototype that demonstrates your innovative ideas about how to strengthen user experience in a specific context(= theme, TBA)
